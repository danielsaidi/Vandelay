## About

Vandelay is a Swift-based iOS importer/exporter. It supports `Codable`, strings and data and comes with built-in support for exporting and importing strings and data to and from a bunch of data sources.


## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

The easiest way to add Vandelay to your project is to use Swift Package Manager:
```
.package(url: "git@github.com:danielsaidi/Vandelay.git" ...)
```

### CocoaPods

```ruby
pod "Vandelay"
```

### Carthage

```ruby
github "danielsaidi/Vandelay"
```

### Manual installation

To add `Vandelay` to your app without a dependency manager, clone this repository, add `Vandelay.xcodeproj` to your project and `Vandelay.framework` as an embedded app binary and target dependency.


## Exporting data

Vandelay uses `exporters` to let you export strings, data and `Encodable`.

Vandelay comes with the following built-in exporters:

- `EmailExporter` - exports `strings` & `data` as email attachments
- `FileExporter` - exports `strings` & `data` to local files
- `MessageExporter` - exports `strings` & `data` as message attachments
- `PasteboardExporter` - exports `strings` to the pasteboard

You can extend Vandelay with custom exporters as well.

Use `string` exporters if you want platform-agnostic, readable exports. Use a `data` exporters when you only have `Data` or when a type can't be serialized.


## Importing data

Vandelay uses `importers` to let you import strings, data and `Decodable` types.

Vandelay comes with the following built-in importers:

- `FileExporter` - imports `strings` & `data` from local files
- `PasteboardExporter` - imports `strings` from the pasteboard
- `UrlExporter` - imports `strings` & `data` from custom urls

You can extend Vandelay with custom importers as well.

When importing, the same goes as when exporting: data is more powerful, but strings are more universal.

### Importing external files

You can use the existing importers to import data by sharing external files to Vandelay, e.g. by tapping an e-mail attachment or sharing a file to the app.  

To import files, your app must be correctly configured to handle the file type. You have to register `Document types` and `Exported Type UTIs` and implement the correct functions in `AppDelegate` (iOS 12 and earlier) or `SceneDelegate` (iOS 13+). Once the functions are triggered, you can use a `UrlImporter` to import the tapped file.

Check out the demo app for an example on how this can be done.


## QR Code support

You can add QR code scanning support with [VandelayQR][VandelayQR]. It lets you import data by scanning QR codes.


## Demo App

This repo contains a demo app that lets you export/import todo items (strings) and photos (data). To run the demo app, open and run the `Vandelay.xcodeproj` project.

The demo app registers a custom file type `.vdl` which it uses to export and import data. Have a look at `Info.plist`, `AppDelegate` and `SceneDelegate` to see how it handles imports.
